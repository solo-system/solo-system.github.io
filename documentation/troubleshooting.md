Troubleshooting
===============

General points / best practices
-------------------------------

* You will find it increasingly important to keep a careful note of
  the field position, date and times of establishing recording,
  particularly if you are using multiple SOLOs

* Remember that the SOLO software has to be flashed onto each SD card
  before each time that it is inserted into the SOLO (not true, but
  safest).

* Try not to unplug the power cable to the minicomputer unless
  necessary since it is a fragile connection. Instead, unplug the
  power cable at the battery end, which is a larger and stronger
  connection. Ensure that the orientation of the connections is
  correct

* Once the battery is connected to the minicomputer do not unplug it -
  wait until the system has fully booted before you turn it off

* ensure the microphone is mounted horizontally to prevent water
  ingress.

* best policy to detach the battery when inserting/removing the
  SD-card.

* write protect slider on sd-cards should be covered in tape to hold
  in place.

* The flashing software and the harvesting software should be
  installed directly on your Windows PC - installations on network
  drives don’t appear to work.  [ I can’t confirm this, and don’t
  understand why].
