There is an [introductory video](https://youtu.be/2Fq05JlEKjw).

The Solo is an autonomous, high definition audio recorder for
unattended environmental monitoring. Protected in a weatherproof
enclosure, the Solo comprises a microphone, mini-computer and battery.
It is tailored for long-term, continuous recording, with data being
stored on a removable memory card.

The Solo is straightforward to assemble, and inexpensive at around
£120 (including a battery, memory card and a really good microphone).
But there's a lot of flexibility with components if you are picky.

A typical deployment (the Solo:basic - pictured above) would be
powered by a USB battery bank which would run the system for five days
of permanent recording, 24 hours per day.  A 12kg car battery runs the
Solo for about 40 days, 24/7.

Recordings are split into manageable 10-minute long files which are
stored on the memory card, grouped into an intuitive folder-per-day
layout.  The recordings are in the .wav format which is compatible
with almost all audio software. Everything is configurable.

It is simple to prepare (flash) the memory card with the software to
run the Solo, and just as easy to harvest the audio data onto your
desktop/laptop using a card reader.  All software is free to download
and licensed openly.
